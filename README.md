This is my Repository for Creative Project #1 for DIG5831

I will be using a combination of Markovify and GPT-2 to craft a computer-generated novel
that can act as a weird cross between a Bible and a self-help book (a weird version of a
religious text). I will exercise somesmall levels of creative license and curation to
develop chapters and chapter titles for the purposes of the novel. 

To run this project, you will need to run Markovify on the "Text-Conglomerate.txt," 
which is  conglomerate text file of the Book of Ecclesiastes and an online, self-published
Self-Help Book. In my run of this part of the project, I chose to select an output with 
500 lines in order to give me a large chunk of text for the GPT-2 to work with. Running it
with 500 lines has it come out to about 10,500 words, which I believe should be a palatable
amount for GPT-2 to work with, and a good amount to develop 3,000 words from for the purposes
of this Creative Assignment.

From here, I saved the 500 lines of output into a text file called "Markovified-Text.txt," 
which I trained using GPT-2. 

After training the text, I experimented with a number of prefix and temperature changes to 
generate some chapters of my book, modeling some of the prefixes after the "section titles" 
that were common in the original text of Ecclesiastes. 

As time went on, I foung that a temperature of 0.6 lent itself well to having some sort
of readbility and zany incoherence that I thought would be interesting to create a kind of
confusion. Rhetorically speaking, I'd imagine that trying to create your own religion and 
way of enjoying life can be confusing at times, so I wanted the text to blend religion
and self-help in a zany and at times confusing kind of way. The temperature of 0.6 created
that weird blend of coherent confusion. 

A length of 1000 turned out to be suitable for these chapters, as a chapter needs to be 
significant in length in order to be a chapter (otherwise it's just a section). I made
my chapters uniform in length and temperature, and I hope that what came of this process
was a weird, zany, self-written chapter of someone's personal Bible. 

The final 3,000 word version of my Novel is saved as "Dani's Bible"
