This is my Repository for Creative Project #1 for DIG5831

I will be using a combination of Markovify and GPT-2 to craft a computer-generated novel
that can act as a weird cross between a Bible and a self-help book. I will exercise some
small levels of creative licens and curation to develop chapters and chapter titles for 
the purposes of the novel. 

To run this project, you will need to run Markovify on the "Text-Conglomerate.txt," 
which is  conglomerate text file of the Book of Ecclesiastes and an online, self-published
Self-Help Book. In my run of this part of the project, I chose to select an output with 
500 lines in order to give me a large chunk of text for the GPT-2 to work with. 

From here, I saved the 500 lines of output into a text file called "Markovified-Text.txt," 
which I trained using GPT-2.
